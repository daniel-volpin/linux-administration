## BIOS ##

The first step to installing either the UEFI or BIOS files is to create an img.raw file and fallocate a
certain size to the file image. After doing so, you need to use the qemu-system-x86_64 with a -drive option
to load the image file into the hypervisor. 

After, opening archlinux there are several steps that were need to be done. First, you need to create a partition
on the the file that we laoded using fdisk. Second, we need to make the file system in the newly create drive, 
using mkfs. Third, we mount the root drive, so we could install the base package using the pacstrap package on our
/mnt drive. Following that, we generate the fstab file, and change to root using arch-chroot /mnt. While we are on
the root we can create a password on our new syste.

The last step is to use GRUB to install our Archlinux. First, I needed to download grub using pacman, and then use 
the grab-install command while pointing to our root folder /dev/sda. Second, we need to create a config file which will
be loaded at the start of the boot. This was done using grub-mkconfig. 

Last, you exit root mode, reboot the system, and open the existing OS.

## UEFI ##

Now, these steps are similar to what needs to be done for the UEFI system too, however, where it differs in is how you
boot into qemu and in how your parition your drives.

First, I made a copy of the following file "/usr/share/edk2-ovmf/x64/OVMF.fd" into my current directory and made sure it
was writable. Second, I created a second img2.raw file which will be loaded. Then, when i ran the qemu command I added the 
following command -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=OVMF.fd next to the img2.raw.

After ArchLinux is opened I needed to use fdisk again, but this time I changed the parition table to GPT, and then I created
two paritions of type EFI, where one was for the efi system, and the other for our arch linux system. From there I followed
the same steps use previosuly, until I had to install grub. When I got to the point of installing grub, I had to use the following
command grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB, while making sure that I mounted everything
correctly.

Following this, I exited, rebooted and was able to boot into my UEFI system.
