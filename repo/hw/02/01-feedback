I enjoyed installing the archlinux boot for UEFI and BIOS, also I find it useful to understand how to get around the installation process and partitioning of the drivers.

Somtimes it was hard to get around the installtion guide, but thats just how tthe archlinux guide is (:

Overall, I enjoyed this week assignments.
