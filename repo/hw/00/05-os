I am using macOS, which is an operating system based on Unix.

macOS has several advantages and disadvantages in its system, which contrast its system from the likes of Windows.

Cons:


- a limited amount of software available as Windows is still the most significant market player, so it is usually more adventagous for companies to produce applications for Windows.
- The system is restricted to components built explicitly for macOS arm computers. Therefore it has very limiting upgradability options.
- due to using a new system architecture (arm), there are limited applications

Pros:


- macOS has a more straightforward user interface due to its simple and easy graphical interface.
- Due to Apple being not only a software company but hardware, it allowed enginners to achieve a high optimiation to its laptop performance, as they have control of everything on the motherboard and the software communication.
- Has fewer malware and vulnerabilities due to its decentralized software deilvery system. They have a strict overlook over the types of applications downloaded from the App store or a browser.
- macOS is free, and Windows is still paid.
