Based on man ssh_config, when using ForwardAgent one should use it carefully, 
as users that have the ability to bypass permissions set on files on the hosting server
can access the local agent easily just throught the forwarded connection. This means that theoretically, an attacker can also perform operations on the keys that will let them authenticate using 
the identities that the users loaded to the agent.
