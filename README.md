## Linux Administration course at Charles University ##

In the following course I have learned the following things:
- How to use hardware-assisted virtualization to run virtual machines at near-native speed with KVM+QEMU
- How to install an Arch Linux-based server from scratch
- How to keep daemons in check with systemd
- How to use lightweight container-based virtualization (Docker, Podman, systemd-nspawn)
- How to use advanced file systems such as Btrfs and build powerful snapshot-based backups
- How to monitor a running system
- How to set up networking - from the very basics to fairly advanced topics such as BGP routing
- How to deploy IPv6
- How to run various networked services (mail, DNS, web, VPNs) securely
- How to debug and repair broken systems and automate boring tasks
