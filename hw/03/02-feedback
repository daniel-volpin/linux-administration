For the following weeks assignment I felt that I was slowly starting to understand my way around the
archlinux guide better, I started to get more accustomed to it.

There was 1 part of the assignment that I found to be confusing, which was the Network Configuration.
The actual process to set it up is simple, and it makes sense once you figure it out. However, the installation guide had too many useless information on their website, which made it harder to understand
how one should set their network.

However, once you set it up it does become clear, and generally I found the configuring the rest
of the system to be easy as I got more comfortable doing changes to the system. When I had certain issues
doing things from the arch linux, I would just go to the bootloader, and modify thing from the ISO. 

Overall, I enjoyed this week tasks.
