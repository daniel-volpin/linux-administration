When we started our first lecture, I immediately noticed how small our English class was; this made it much easier to talk to the professor, engage more, 
and ask more questions. This is something that I very much enjoyed.

One thing that I did not entirely like on the course website was that the labs' instructions felt a bit vague and, at times, confusing. I think giving a 
bit more guidance could be helpful, especially for week 0 assignments.

Nevertheless, I did find it fun to go through the lab assignments and use the terminal.
