I think that the mini assignments for 5, where much harder than previous assignments. I think that giving
a bit more explanation and intuition behind assignments like the systemd unit systems would have been
more beneficial. It felt that I had to catch up on things, and from there it only got worse.

I was ablet to do resizing and systemd unit files, a bit after deadline. I hope that regardless you will
consideer awarding the points as it was a challenge to complete those.
