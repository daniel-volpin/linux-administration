For resizing I have only used the fdisk and dd commands to resize the partition tables.

First, I started with the ext4 partition, I used the following command to make a backup of the data:

dd if=/dev/sda2 of=sda2.img

After that: fdisk /dev/sda, deleted 2nd partition. Created new parition of size 100M. Removed ext4 signature.
Then created another new parition of 300M.

Then I used resize2fs on sda2.img since it's an ext4, while using the -M 300MB flag, to resize the filesystem size.

dd if=sda2.img of=/dev/sda3

Once this was done, I went back to fdisk and deleted the previously 100MB partition. Also, I delete the sda2.img and created a new backup of the btrfs partition data:

dd if=/dev/sda1 of=sda1.img

Following that, I created a new partition of size 500MB, without deleting the signature. 

Now, I need to grow the btrfs image, this can be done in the following way:

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
btrfs filesystem resize 500m /mnt.

Last, just for my OCD, since I have /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda3. I used fdisk to remove /dev/sda3 without removing the signature/data, and then created a new partition of size 300M.
